The nominals are inflected in the following Case and Number
 *  +Pred	 = predestinative
are these needed
derivative suffixes before case endings

Semantics are classified with


Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
source and target part-of-speech.
modifier without noun head
this is used with predication of nominals and deverbal modalities
+Aud+PxSg1+Der/Pr+Prt1+ScSg3


Morphophonology
---------------
To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:
  %{ая%}     in Pros
  %{оё%}     in +N+Sg+Nom+PxPl3
  %{рл%}	    +N+Sg+Nom+PxSg2

  %{аяуюØ%}	 хан+N+Sg+Acc+PxSg1: ханув, ханав
  %{увм%}    +N+Sg+Pros
  %{вм%}	    +N+Sg+Nom+PxSg1
And following triggers to control variation
  %^SCSG2     this allows n2d +V+Ind+Aor+ScSg2:%>н°%^SCSG2
  %^PLNOM     disallows i2e +N+Pl+Nom+PxDu1+Der/Pr+V+Ind+Aor+ScPl3

  %{ауоэØ%}   А1:а А1:у А1:о А1:э schwa
  %{ауоэиыØ%}  before pros
   This is the schwa or reduced vowel occurring after x in case endings
-хА1на -хА1д
Alternating between zero and а


Initially this is used for the noun "я" to enable a:o
for я:и in пя
м:в м:б
  %^VowLower  vowel lowering ы:э у:о
э:ы о:у
stem-final vowel is lost in plural accusative form
  %^StemVowFronting  хасава:хасев
  %^VowFronting  хадась:хадэйнинзь
in combination with stem-final vowel loss
яля:ялэ

We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics:

Object conjugation



The word forms in UNDEFINED language start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:
